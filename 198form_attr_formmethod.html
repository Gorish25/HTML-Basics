<!-- The input formmethod attribute defines the HTTP method for sending form-data to the action URL.

Note: This attribute overrides the method attribute of the <form> element.

The formmethod attribute works with the following input types: submit and image.

The form-data can be sent as URL variables (method="get") or as an HTTP post transaction (method="post").

Notes on the "get" method:

This method appends the form-data to the URL in name/value pairs
This method is useful for form submissions where a user want to bookmark the result
There is a limit to how much data you can place in a URL (varies between browsers), therefore, you cannot be sure that all of the form-data will be correctly transferred
Never use the "get" method to pass sensitive information! (password or other sensitive information will be visible in the browser's address bar)


Notes on the "post" method:

This method sends the form-data as an HTTP post transaction
Form submissions with the "post" method cannot be bookmarked
The "post" method is more robust and secure than "get", and "post" does not have size limitations -->
